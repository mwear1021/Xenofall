Xenofall is a capstone team project for my Air Force software development course. I was tasked with organizing it into a Flask project and programming the backend (app.py and the database), as well as some aspects of the game logic and styling the game page (/game). Xenofall is a retro-inspired 2D space shooter game, reminiscent of classics like Galaxian, where players control a spacecraft to fend off waves of alien invaders. Players can collect power-ups to enhance their offensive capabilities however the enemies dynamically respond adding a layer of difficulty for the player. Xenofall came about as the "Xeno" means alien and "fall" was added because the alien enemies fall toward the player's ship.

To run the game, you must first enter in terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt

Then launch the flask server on 127.0.0.1 with the command: python -m flask run
